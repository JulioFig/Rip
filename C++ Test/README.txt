*---------------------------------------*

commands to try:

make           //this will compile (note this is the same command as "make default"

make bare      //this will delete bin folder and the Test.exe

make clean     //this will only delete the Test.exe from the folder bin

make run       //this will compile and run 

make compile   //this will compile the program
